# WildRoga

WildRoga is an app that focuses on yoga and wellness. As a Developer on a team of 6, we developed a mobile application and dashboard for the admin to update content for their users. 

The main features of the app are: 

- Live Steam content
- Pre-recorded videos 
- Community Wall
- Multiple Payment options

The tech we used are:
- React Native, Expo (app)
- Firebase (data storage)
- MUX (open the live stream channel)
- Ecamm Live (live stream software)
- Stripe (process payments)
- Next.js (dashboard)

The project was among the top 5 finalists of the Algonquin College RE/ACTION Showcase in April 2022.
